# Critically analyzing and reviewing ’Plural self-awareness’ by Hans Bernhard Schmid

## 
With regard to the course Philosophy of social minds, the text “Plural self-awareness” can be categorized into the field of collective intentionality. Collective intentionality refers to the cognitive and social processes involved in the shared understanding and shared goals of groups of people. Collective intentionality is the ability of a group of people to have a shared understanding of a situation, to coordinate their actions, and to work together towards a common goal. The concept of collective intentionality has been studied in the fields of philosophy, psychology, and sociology. It is closely related to the idea of collective action, which is the ability of a group of people to work together to achieve a common goal. Moreover, it is thought to be a fundamental aspect of human sociality, and it is important for many aspects of social life, such as cooperation, coordination, and communication. It is also thought to be important for the formation and maintenance of social groups, as well as for the emergence of social norms and institutions. The key feature of collective intentionality is the shared understanding and shared goals among the group members. People in a group with collective intentionality understand that they are all working towards the same goal, and they can coordinate their actions and communicate effectively to achieve that goal. It is also crucial that the group members share a common perspective and that they are aware of each other’s intentions. Moreover, collective intentionality is also closely related to the concept of joint action, which refers to the ability of people to coordinate their actions in time and space. Joint action is thought to be a prerequisite for collective intentionality, as it enables people to work together to achieve a common goal. Generally speaking, collective intentionality is a complex and multidimensional concept that refers to the cognitive and social processes involved in the shared understanding and shared goals of groups of people. It plays a critical role in human sociality and enables people to cooperate, coordinate, and communicate effectively to achieve a common goal. Collective intentionality is closely related to joint action and it is crucial for the formation and maintenance
of social groups, as well as for the emergence of social norms and institutions. Choosing a phenomenological approach, Schmid is claiming in his text that the so-called sense of us is plural pre-reflective
self-awareness.
