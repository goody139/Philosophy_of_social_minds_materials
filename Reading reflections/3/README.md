# Critically analyzing and reviewing ”THE SEX/GENDER DISTINCTION AND THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY” by Sally Haslanger

## 
With regard to the course Philosophy of social minds, the text ”THE SEX/GENDER DISTINCTION AND THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY” can be categorized into the field of social construction. Social construction is the idea that societal beliefs, norms, and values shape and construct our understanding and perception of reality, rather than reality being a fixed or objective truth. This concept holds that human experiences and concepts are shaped by social and cultural context. The challenge of social construction lies in its ability to shape and influence our perceptions and beliefs, often in unconscious and unrecognized ways, which can lead to a reinforcement of unequal power dynamics and oppressive social norms, limited perspectives and narrow-mindedness, a difficulty in accepting and acknowledging different experiences and realities, or a maintenance of stereotypes and biases. Thus, it is challenging to critically examine and understand the impact of social construction on our thoughts and actions, and strive towards a more inclusive and equitable society.
Changing or questioning the construction of our social ideas and concepts can help us creating a more equitable society
