# Critically analyzing and reviewing ’Groups as agents’ by Deborah Perron Tollefsen

## 
With regard to the course Philosophy of social minds, the given text can be categorized into the field of collective moral responsibility. Collective moral responsibility refers to the idea that a group or society can be held accountable for the actions of its members and the consequences that result from those actions. It suggests that individuals within a group are collectively responsible for promoting good and avoiding harm, regardless of their individual actions or intentions. The main challenge of collective moral responsibility is assigning blame and determining accountability in situations where the actions and decisions of many individuals contribute to a harmful outcome. This can make it difficult to determine who is responsible for the harm and how to allocate appropriate consequences. Additionally, there may be differing opinions on what constitutes harm and what actions should be taken to prevent it, leading to disagreements and difficulties in achieving collective responsibility. According to Tollefsen, groups can be morally responsible
if they have normative competency, denoting the capacity to appreciate normative considerations, ascertain relevant information and engage in effective deliberation, because they are then appropriate targets of reactive attitudes. Ergo, some
groups are morally responsible.
